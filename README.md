# 📘 **Operate and Monitor Kafka Clusters**

### Official Companion Code for the Pluralsight Course by **Rupesh Tiwari**

This repository hosts all the code, configs, scripts, and resources used in the Pluralsight course **Operate and Monitor Kafka Clusters**.

The goal is simple:
Provide a clean, repeatable environment so learners can **practice every operational workflow** taught in the course.

## 🎯 **Course Overview**

Modern applications rely heavily on Apache Kafka, but operating Kafka safely in production requires deep understanding of:

* Broker and topic health
* Consumer lag and rebalancing
* ISR behavior and replication guarantees
* Leadership distribution and partition balance
* Storage pressure, retention enforcement, and log behavior
* Producer and consumer tuning
* Recovery workflows after failures

Every demo in this repo simulates a **real-world operational scenario** that Kafka engineers face in production.

```

Each demo folder contains:

* A **README** with step-by-step instructions
* All scripts used in the Pluralsight video
* `docker-compose.yml`
* Reusable helper scripts
* Expected output or screenshots

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**

This course uses:

* **Apache Kafka 3.x** (KRaft + ZooKeeper variants)
* **Docker Compose** for multi-broker environments
* **kafka-topics**, **kafka-consumer-groups**, **kafka-producer-perf-test**
* **VS Code** + integrated terminal
* **Linux-friendly tools** (watch, awk, bash scripts)

Everything runs cleanly on:

* macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon)
* Windows (WSL2 recommended)
* Linux

---

## 🚀 **How to Run Any Demo**

Every demo can be executed independently.

```bash
cd code/module-1/demo-1-inspect-brokers
docker compose up -d
```

Then follow the instructions in the corresponding README.

**Tip:**
If you are learning Kafka operations seriously, run each demo *twice* — once following instructions, once improvising failures.
